# AdvancedDataMining
In this repository you may find data and code used for a machine learning project in sensor data done in collaboration with my colleagues Lorenzo Ferri and Roberta Pappolla at the University of Pisa. <br>

This is an analysis of the 'Room Occupancy Dataset' with the purpose of predicting whether a person is present in the room or not solely based on the sensor data on the quantity of light, CO2, humidity, etc. Project was a compulsory part of the Data Mining II: Advanced Topics and Applications course at the University of Pisa. </br></br>
In folders and subfolders of this directory, you may find Jupyter Notebooks dealing with this dataset in following respects: </br>
-Advanced Classification (SVM,SVC, Convolutional and Recurrent NN, Deep NN,
Ensemble Classifiersâ€¦) & Clustering (K-Means, DB Scan, Transactional C.) </br>
-Time Series Analysis & Forecasting (Dynamic Time Warping, Motifs, Shapelets, TS Classification & Clustering) </br>
-Dimensionality Reduction with PCA, SVD, UFS, RFEâ€¦ </br>
-Sequential Pattern Mining (GSP Algorithm) </br>
-Outlier&Anomaly Detection (ABOD, LOF, KNN, COF, INFLO, Grid-Basedâ€¦) </br>
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) </br>
-Explainable Machine Learning </br>
-Imbalanecd Learning </br>
