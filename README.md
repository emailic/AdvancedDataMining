# AdvancedDataMining
In this repository you may find data and code used for a machine learning project done in collaboration with my colleagues Lorenzo Ferri and Roberta Pappolla. 

This is an analysis of the 'Room Occupancy Dataset' with the purpose of predicting whether a person is present in the room or not solely based on the quantity of light, CO2, humidity, etc. Project was a compulsory part of the Data Mining II: Advanced Topics and Applications university course. 
-Advanced Classification (SVM,SVC, Convolutional and Recurrent NN, Deep NN,
Ensemble Classifiers…) & Clustering (K-Means, DB Scan, Transactional C.)
-Time Series Analysis & Forecasting (Dynamic Time Warping, Motifs, Shapelets, TS Classification & Clustering)
-Dimensionality Reduction with PCA, SVD, UFS, RFE…
-Sequential Pattern Mining (GSP Algorithm)
-Outlier&Anomaly Detection (ABOD, LOF, KNN, COF, INFLO, Grid-Based…)
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-Explainable Machine Learning
